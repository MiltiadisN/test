# Configuration
**1. Create a Database:** Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database. You can use any name you prefer it doesn't have to be named "employee_task_v1" like in my example.    
**2. Update application.properties:** If you chose a different database name, make sure to update the database name in the property file. Look at the image below, where the database name is       highlighted.

**3. Update Username, Password:** Make sure to update the database username and password to match your MySQL configuration.

Just create the database, no need to worry about creating tables. When you run the application, Hibernate will automatically generate the required tables within the "employee_task_v1" database.   
**4. Email Configuration:** Update application.properties for Email Configuration.
